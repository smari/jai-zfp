# jai-zfp

These are basic bindings for [ZFP](https://github.com/LLNL/zfp) for use in Jai. See the project
page at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/zfp) for more 
info.

Currently only supports Linux.

To use: 

 1. Checkout module to your modules dir as "ZFP". 
 2. Initialize submodule `zfp` and build it (see README there).
 3. Import "ZFP" into your project and enjoy.

Example compression function (super naive, take as inspiration only):

```
#import "ZFP";

...
function my_compress :: (data: *float64, sizex: int, sizey: int, sizez: int) -> string {
    output : string;

    type: zfp_type = zfp_type_double;
    field := zfp_field_3d(data, type, sizex, sizey, sizez);
    zfp := zfp_stream_open(null);
    zfp_stream_set_accuracy(zfp, 0.0001);

    output.count = xx zfp_stream_maximum_size(zfp, field);
    output.data = alloc(output.count);

    stream := stream_open(destination.data, destination.count);
    zfp_stream_set_bit_stream(zfp, stream);
    zfp_stream_rewind(zfp);

    zfpsize := zfp_compress(zfp, field);

    zfp_field_free(field);
    zfp_stream_close(zfp);
    stream_close(stream);

    return output;
}
```
